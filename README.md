# Taxi Fare Prediction Model

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict taxi fares based on various input features such as trip distance, time, and location. The model is developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook, incorporating data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training techniques.

## Dataset
- The dataset includes historical taxi trip records with fare amounts.
- Features may include:
  - Pickup and drop-off locations (latitude, longitude)
  - Trip duration
  - Passenger count
  - Date and time of travel
  - Additional ride information

## Dependencies
To run this project, install the following Python libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Workflow
1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze distributions, missing values, and correlations.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features such as time-based variables and distance calculations.
4. **Model Selection**: Train models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess performance using metrics like RMSE and R-squared.
6. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict taxi fares for new trip data.

## Running the Notebook
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook TAXI FARE PREDICTION MODEL.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to train and test the model.

## Results
- The model predicts taxi fares based on input features with reasonable accuracy.
- Feature importance analysis highlights key factors influencing fare prices.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance feature engineering (e.g., include weather or traffic data).
- Implement deep learning models for better predictions.
- Deploy as a web API for real-time fare estimation.
